  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="text"><p>FusionCharts uses XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to 
        create and manipulate charts. XML is a simple and structured language 
        that is easy to read and understand. In case you're not aware of XML as 
        yet, here are a few basics things to know about an XML document:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> An XML document is a simple text file consisting of tags and data 
          associated with them.</li>
        <li>You can make up your own tags like <span class="codeInline">&lt;mytag&gt;&lt;/mytag&gt;</span><span class="text"> 
          to store data</span></li>
        <li>Every opening tag requires a matching closing tag. Like <span class="codeInline">&lt;name&gt;</span> 
          requires <span class="codeInline">&lt;/name&gt;</span>. e.g.,<span class="codeInline"> 
          &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;</span><span class="codetext">. </span>If 
          an element has no content, the opening and closing tags may be combined 
          into a single &quot;shortcut&quot; tag such as <span class="codeInline">&lt;name/&gt;</span><span class="codetext">.</span> 
        </li>
        <li>XML tags are case-sensitive. So <span class="codeInline">&lt;name&gt;</span> 
          should be closed with<span class="codetext"> </span><span class="codeInline">&lt;/name&gt;</span> 
          and not <span class="codeInline">&lt;/Name&gt;</span> or<span class="codetext"> 
          </span><span class="codeInline">&lt;/NAME&gt;</span><span class="codetext"> 
          </span>or any other variant of the same.</li>
        <li>You can define attributes for a tag to render more details. e.g.,<span class="codetext"> 
          </span><span class="codeInline">&lt;name isPetName='true'&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;</span>. 
          Here <span class="codeInline">isPetName</span> is an attribute of the 
          <span class="codetext">name</span> element. In FusionCharts, we've 
          four types of attributes: 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean</strong> - Attributes which can take a 0 or 1 
              value. Like<span class="codeInline"> &lt;graph showNames='1' &gt;</span></li>
            <li><strong>Number</strong> - Attributes which take a numeric value. 
              Like <span class="codeInline">&lt;graph yAxisMaxValue='200' &gt;</span></li>
            <li><strong>String</strong> - Attributes which take a string value. 
              Like <span class="codeInline">&lt;graph caption='My Chart' &gt;</span></li>
            <li><strong>Hex Color Code</strong> - Attributes that take a hex color 
              code (without #). Like <span class="codeInline">&lt;graph bgColor='FFFFDD' 
              &gt;</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Special characters like ' (quote), &quot; (double quote), % (percentage) 
          etc are to be replaced by the XML converts. Like, the character &quot; 
          (double quote) in a string constant must be denoted as <span class="codetext">&amp;quot;. 
          </span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The entire FusionCharts chart is controlled by XML parameters i.e., you 
        use XML to define the cosmetic as well as functional properties for the 
        chart. There are a lot of properties that you can define for each chart 
        type. </p>
      <p>However, it is not necessary to define all the attributes for a given 
        chart. For example, if you do not want to change the default setting of 
        the canvas (color, alpha etc.), you don't need to define any attributes 
        for the canvas - the default values will be assumed. Thus, each chart 
        can be generated using minimal attributes without concern  for finer details. As you become more proficient in the chart attributes, you could 
        use it to create complex charts with a wide range of features and an informative 
        appearance.</p>
      <p>FusionCharts has a specific XML structure for each chart. Broadly, we 
        define the XML structure into following types, depending on the chart 
        type:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><u>Single Series Charts</u></strong><br>
          Single Series Charts are those which depict only one set of data on 
          the chart. Like, our previous example of Monthly sales summary was a 
          single series chart, as we had just one data set (i.e., data for 1 year). 
          In that chart, we were not comparing data between two datasets (e.g., 
          monthly sales comparison between two or more years).<br>
          <br>
          XML for the single series chart is the simplest to understand, as you've 
          already seen in the previous examples.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>Multi-Series Charts</u></strong><u><br>
          </u>Multi-series charts are used to compare 2 or more datasets like 
          monthly comparison for 2 or more years. Under multi-series charts, we 
          can define the following subcategories: 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Multi-series Charts</strong><br>
              The standard multi-series charts, like multi-series column, line, 
              area etc., are used for straightforward comparison of various datasets 
              on the chart.<br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Stacked Charts<br>
              </strong>Stacked charts, like stacked column, area etc., are used 
              to compare cumulative or grouped data. e.g., monthly summary of 
              sales on a chart. Say if we wanted to show which part of revenue 
              came from products and which part from services, we can use the 
              stacked column chart easily to depict the data. Each month would 
              represent a data column and the column would be divided into two 
              parts- one representing service and the other product. <br>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Combination Charts</strong><br>
              Combination Charts are a combination of two or more charts or y-axis. 
              <br />
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><u>Financial Charts </u></strong><br>
           The candlestick chart is a special type of chart basically meant for plotting   financial stock market data. There are four elements necessary to construct a candlestick chart, the OPEN,   HIGH, LOW and CLOSE price for a given time period.<br>
        </li>
