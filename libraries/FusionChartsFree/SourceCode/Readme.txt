Structure of source code
---------------------------
In FusionCharts Free, each chart type is a .fla file that accepts
an XML data in the required format. To look for .fla file for a chart,
search for the folder resembling the name of chart.

How to compile the charts?
---------------------------
You'll need Flash MX IDE or Flash 8 IDE to compile the charts. The 
charts are to be compiled as ActionScript 1 (Flash 6) SWF files. This
is the default setting in Flash MX IDE. In Flash 8, you'll need to 
configure the same under File > Publish Settings > Flash.
