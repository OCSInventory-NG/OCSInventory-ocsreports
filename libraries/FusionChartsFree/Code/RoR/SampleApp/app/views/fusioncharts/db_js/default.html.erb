		<TITLE>FusionCharts Free - Client Side Dynamic Chart (using Database) Example</TITLE>
		<%
			 #In this example, we show a combination of database + JavaScript rendering using FusionCharts.
			 #The entire example (page) can be summarized as under. This app shows the break-down
			 #of factory wise output generated. In a pie chart, we first show the sum of quantity
			 #generated by each factory. These pie slices, when clicked would show detailed date-wise
			 #output of that factory.
			
			 #The XML data for the pie chart is fully created in the controller at run-time. The controller interacts
			 #with the database and creates the XML for this.
			 #Now, for the column chart (date-wise output report), we do not submit request to the server.
			 #Instead we store the data for the factories in JavaScript arrays. These JavaScript
			 #arrays are rendered by our ruby Code (at run-time). We also have a few defined JavaScript
			 #functions which react to the click event of pie slice.
			
	
			 #Before the page is rendered, we need to connect to the database and get the
			 #data, as we'll need to convert this data into JavaScript variables.
			
			 #The js_var_string will contain the JS Data and variables.
			 #This string will be built in the controller and rendered at run-time as JavaScript.
